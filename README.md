# gpx_extender

The GPX Extender is a wireless link between the P1 port and the GPX Connector. It uses an STM32L011F4P6 and an off the shelf NRF24L01+ module to transparently transmit P1 port data. The device acts as transmitter when connected to the P1 port or as receiver when connected to the GPX Connector.
